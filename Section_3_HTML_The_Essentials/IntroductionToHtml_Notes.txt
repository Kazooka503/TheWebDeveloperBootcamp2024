HTML is a markup language.
Hyper Text Markup Language.

HTML was first created to help describe the structure of academic research papers.

The goal of HTML is to take text content and mark it up with structure.

HTML ELEMENTS
To write HTML, we pick from a set of standard Elements that all browsers recognize.
Common Elements include:

<p> element - represents a paragraph of text
<h1> element - represents the main header on a page
<img> element - embeds an image
<form> element - represents a form

HTML TAGS
We create elements by writing tags. 
Most (but not all) elements consist of an opening and closing tag.

<p>I am a paragraph</p>
